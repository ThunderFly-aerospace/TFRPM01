# TFRPM01
Revolutions per minute meter for UAV. 
It is designed to direct connection to Pixhawk controller (CUAV V5+) trough standard IÂ²C connector. 
At the input of meter is supposed a pulse signal from optical encoder, hall sensor etc. 
The hardware is inteded to be used for helicopter and autogyro rotor RPM measurement, but its counting capability is up to 20 kHz therefore it should be used for propeller or engine RPM measurement.
